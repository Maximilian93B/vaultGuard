## Notes
(1) I ran into some issues with the project at first but the issues were quickly resolved after reviewing the script. minor syntax errors cause the gerenator to not load when prompted. 

(2) over all was a great little project, was a great way to re call lessons from the past week as well as force you to search for answers using open source materials. 

(3) if you made it this far down the read me... Thanks
